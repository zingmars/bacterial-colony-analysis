Sample script for miscnn testing.
===

1. Pull MIScnn from [here](https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/MIScnn) into this directory.
2. Get data from [here](https://github.com/neheller/kits19/tree/master) and read the instructions on how to get the imaging data. Then copy the data folder here.
3. Source for this can be found [here](https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/MIScnn/blob/master/examples/KiTS19.ipynb)!
4. Run the script. It should work as-is. Feel free to cancel when you've confirmed that it loads the data and starts the training.
